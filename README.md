# -fake-news-headlines-Classification-with-Nearest-Neighbours-
We will use a dataset of 1298 “fake news” headlines (which mostly include headlines of articles classified as biased, etc.) and 1968 “real” news headlines, where the “fake news” headlines are from https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news/data and “real news” headlines are from https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/million-headlines. The data were cleaned by removing words from titles not part of the headlines, removing special characters and restricting real news headlines after October 2016 using the word ”trump”.
